Social media has emerged as an unsung hero in the world of e-commerce. It serves not only as a channel to direct shoppers toward new products and attractive deals but, more importantly, as a platform to foster engagement and cultivate a sense of community. This ability to connect with customers on a personal level is an invaluable asset. It not only sets the stage for the creation of a dedicated community of loyal customers but also provides a powerful platform for extending outreach and brand exposure.

A crucial component of the project presented its own challenges. However, Microsoft Excel proved to be a versatile tool, and a color-picker in PowerPoint facilitated adherence to company branding. The result was visually engaging and informative representations of the data
